        <h3 id="headline">The following list of resources helped me to learn to crochet:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a
                    id="tribute-link"
                    href="https://www.ravelry.com/account/login"
                    target="_blank"
            >Read patterns</a
            ></strong> - Research free crochet patterns for amigurumi, sweaters, or other projects to
                see what stitches are used. Ravelry has many free patterns, but you need to make a free
                account to search for them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><a
                        id="tribute-link2"
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZesdWQG9YA"
                        target="_blank"
                >Research general how-tos</a
                ></strong> - Search for videos on how to crochet in general to find lots of useful
                tips. These videos go over how to hold your supplies and how to do a simple
                stitch.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><a
                        id="tribute-link3"
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDHqT_rYMlM"
                        target="_blank">Research common beginner's traps</a></strong> - Search for information on common
                beginner mistakes. Learning
                from others' mistakes is a great way to quickly advance your own skills!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><a
                        id="tribute-link4"
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GfMqmyw4Xg"
                        target="_blank"
                >Research any stitch you read about for the first time</a
                ></strong> - When you read patterns on Ravelry or another place,
                you may come across abbreviations for stitches you don't know--sc for single crochet,
                dc for double crochet, etc. You should search for what these terms mean and
                learn how to do them!
            </li>

            <li>
                <strong><a
                        id="tribute-link5"
                        href="https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/crochet-abbreviations-978358"
                        target="_blank"
                >Research stitch abbreviations</a
                ></strong> - Speaking of learning new stitches, you could research common
                stitches beforehand to at least learn their names!
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Try to practice a lot!</strong> - Once you learn enough stitches to
                create projects (you may only need the single crochet and the slip knot!),
                it is easier to practice more and more. Working towards the creation of a project
                gives you a nice goal to work towards and counts as practice!
